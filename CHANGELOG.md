### Fixed

- **`ask-page` Playwright suite no longer fails 5 of 11 tests at CI's `workers: 1`** ([#74](https://github.com/vig-os/revkit/issues/74))
  - The spec booted one daemon in `beforeAll` and replayed that daemon's
    single-use startup launch URL from 11 call sites, so every navigation
    after the first got a 403 from `/-/auth`. Each test now mints its own
    code through the existing `POST /-/launch-code` agent endpoint, which
    also removes the 60 s expiry path. `fullyParallel` hid this locally
    (one worker, and so one daemon, per test) and `retries: 2` hid it in
    CI (a retry re-runs `beforeAll` and gets a fresh code).
