# ADR-0007: Agent bridge: MCP server as a channel, Monitor fallback, delivery modes

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-09-29
- Design: [DESIGN-0001](../designs/DESIGN-0001-revkit-architecture.md)
- Stories: A1, A3, A5

## Context

Comments and answers must reach the agent live, not on the next prompt (A1, A5).

## Decision

`revkit mcp` exposes `ask`/`await_answer`/`threads`/`reply`/`resolve`/`publish` and declares the `claude/channel`
capability, so events arrive mid-turn and while the user is away. Fallbacks: `Monitor` on the daemon's WebSocket
(`/events`), then a UserPromptSubmit hook. Delivery modes are `handover` (default, batched), `live` and `quiet`, plus
an `@agent now` override; presence events come from agent edits.

## Consequences

Channels are a research preview (`--channels` allowlist or the development flag). `ask` never blocks a single tool
call on a human.

## Acceptance (2026-09-29)

- **Channel-first** (owner decision): M2 builds the `claude/channel` server as the primary path, run with
  `--dangerously-load-development-channels server:revkit` until the plugin is published on an allowlisted marketplace;
  the Monitor-WebSocket path is the supported fallback for sessions without channels, and the UserPromptSubmit hook
  the last resort.
- Default delivery mode is `handover`.
- Ask/answer history stays local (`.revkit/asks/`, gitignored); `revkit ask --keep` promotes one into
  `docs/decisions/` as a committed record.
