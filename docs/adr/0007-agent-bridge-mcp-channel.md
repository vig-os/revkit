# ADR-0007: Agent bridge: MCP server as a channel, Monitor fallback, delivery modes

- Status: Proposed
- Date: 2026-09-29
- Design: [DESIGN-0001](../designs/DESIGN-0001-revkit-architecture.md)
- Stories: A1, A3, A5

## Context

Comments and answers must reach the agent live, not on the next prompt (A1, A5).

## Decision

`revkit mcp` exposes `ask`/`await_answer`/`threads`/`reply`/`resolve`/`publish` and declares the `claude/channel`
capability, so events arrive mid-turn and while the user is away. Fallbacks: `Monitor` on the daemon's WebSocket
(`/events`), then a UserPromptSubmit hook. Delivery modes are `handover` (default, batched), `live` and `quiet`, plus
an `@agent now` override; presence events come from agent edits.

## Consequences

Channels are a research preview (`--channels` allowlist or the development flag). `ask` never blocks a single tool
call on a human.
